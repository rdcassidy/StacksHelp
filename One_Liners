ONE LINERS

This file is a repository of one liners that are useful for Sergi's ddRADseq protocol.

1. When creating a blacklist of samples departing Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, this command first counts the number HWE values (column 20) below 0.05 for each unique ID, and then creates a txt file of the IDs for which two or more were below 0.05. 

awk -F'\t' '{print $1 "\t" $20}' populations.sumstats.tsv | sed '1,8d' | awk -F'\t' '{if ($2 < 0.05) counts[$1]++} END {for (key in counts) print key "\t" counts[key]}' output1.tsv | awk -F'\t' '$2 >= 2 {print $1}' > blacklist_trial.txt
